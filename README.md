# selenium-scraper
A fun little project to scrape a react JS website with Selenium.

The main motivation was to create an offline copy of an existing
website written with react. All other approaches (either via wget or httrack)
failed, so had to use Python.

At the end of the day, the raw HTML code is saved, 
with the corresponding data just being stored in the same folder.
